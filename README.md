# WordleSolver
Used frequency analysis and graph search to find optimal guesses for every Wordle answer possibility. Average guesses are equivalent to fully-optimized Wordle bots on the Wordle bot leaderboard. Manual mode allows users to input their guesses and get suggestions for followup guesses, while automatic will test every solution case to get the average number of guesses.
